## Professional Summary
Bridging Bench and Code to Solve Biomedical Challenges
ðŸ”¬ Experimental Biologist | ðŸ’» Computational Biologist | ðŸ“Š Data Alchemist

I thrive at the intersection of wet-lab science and computational innovation, leveraging dual expertise to decode biological complexity into actionable insights. With a foundation in molecular biology and advanced training in machine learning-driven bioinformatics, I design experiments and algorithms that answer why and howâ€”whether dissecting host-pathogen interactions or modeling cancer genomics.

What I Bring to the Table:
- Experimental Biology: Mastery of molecular techniques (RNA-seq, CRISPR, histology) and preclinical models.
- Computational Biology: End-to-end pipeline development for multi-omics integration, phylogenetics, and biomarker discovery.
- Machine Learning: Building predictive models (random forests, neural networks) to stratify disease risk and optimize therapies.
- Translational Impact: Passion for turning data into decisionsâ€”from precision medicine platforms to clinical diagnostics.

My Playground:
- Tools: Python | R | TensorFlow | PyTorch | Linux/HPC | AWS/Google Cloud
- Domains: Oncology, Infectious Disease, Drug Discovery, Synthetic Biology
- Mindset: "Bench-to-benchmarking"â€”I connect lab experiments to computational workflows, ensuring biological relevance at every step.

Why Work With Me?
Iâ€™ve spearheaded projects like Kabosu, an AI-driven precision medicine tool integrating multi-omics data, and published on CRISPR innovations. Whether optimizing a neural network to predict drug responses or troubleshooting a qPCR assay, I bridge disciplines to deliver robust, reproducible science.

Open to Roles That Demand:
- Hybrid experimental/computational problem-solving.
- Scalable bioinformatics pipelines for genomics or proteomics.
- Machine learning applications in drug discovery or diagnostics.
